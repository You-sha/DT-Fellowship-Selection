Neha,around 75%,half,>85%,"""So, as we're reaching to the final part of our internship we finalized our final agenda """"Digital Media Marketing"""" is one of the main KPI's on our bucket list -

Regarding this, we as a team decide what we plan to do : 
*Content Front 

1) One time it could be creating a strategy report.
2) Another time it could be creating post content & have a discussion around it
3) Some other time it could be designing analytics for the posts we've created and sharing our thoughts on that analysis stating where we can improve better
so on and so forth ... so as our agenda is clear we will decide what can be planned this week as a part of KPI/OKR's

Coming back to the point there's a 
*Product front as well

So every week I will be receiving the upcoming week's plan - Features to be worked on kind of Plan of Action for internal team members (Dreamworks.co)
